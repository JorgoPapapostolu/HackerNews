Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. 
It is funded by the Y Combinator incubator. 
Itâ€™s a popular platform to get your daily dose of tech related stuff.

I just build a version of Hacker News with a search feature by using their API: https://hn.algolia.com/api
